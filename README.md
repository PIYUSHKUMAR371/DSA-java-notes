🧠 DSA-Java Notes & Practice

This repository contains my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice notes and examples using Java. It’s designed to help me strengthen my problem-solving skills and learn how to implement common data structures and algorithms in Java.

Every file includes well-commented explanations that make the logic easy to understand and practice.

🎯 What’s Included

This repository focuses on core DSA topics implemented in Java:

✔ Arrays & Linked Lists
✔ Stacks & Queues
✔ Trees & Binary Trees
✔ Graphs (basic exploration)
✔ Searching & Sorting Algorithms
✔ Recursion techniques
✔ Hashing & Hash Tables
✔ Time/Space complexity notes
✔ Practice problems & solutions

📂 Project Structure
DSA-Java-Notes/
│
├── [Java files]       # Algorithms & data structure implementations
├── README.md          # Project overview

Each .java file contains examples, logic, and comments so you can read, practice, and modify the code to learn DSA effectively.

🛠️ Running the Code

To compile and run any Java file:

Compile:

javac FileName.java

Run:

java FileName

Alternatively, you can use any Java IDE like:

IntelliJ IDEA

Eclipse

NetBeans

VS Code (with Java extensions)

📈 What You’ll Learn

By working with this repository, you will:

✔ Understand key DSA concepts with Java
✔ Build logic to solve programming problems
✔ Learn how to implement data structures from scratch
✔ Improve problem-solving & coding strength
✔ Prepare for interviews and competitive coding

⭐ Future Improvements

I plan to add:

✨ More advanced algorithms (Dynamic Programming)
✨ Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
✨ Example problems from coding platforms
✨ Explanations with time/space complexity
✨ Test cases for each implementation
